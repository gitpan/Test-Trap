Revision history for Test-Trap

0.0.17	Sat Sep 23 00:47:13 CEST 2006
	Overview:
	 - Test::Temp gets new optional layers:
		:stdout(perlio)
		:stdout(tempfile)
		:stderr(perlio)
		:stderr(tempfile)
	 - Test::Temp interface is otherwise unchanged.
	 - Test::Trap::Builder interface is mostly unchanged, but now:
	    - treats braces in layer names as syntactical;
	    - has an interface for registering output layer backends;
	    - also lets you register default backends;
	    - has some more changes in non-interface (internal) functions.
	 - Test::Trap::Builder::TempFile added.
	 - Test::Trap::Builder::PerlIO added.
	Added a File::Temp backend for output layers, and require it.
	Made the PerlIO backend optional, and require no more than 5.6.0.
	Moved each backend to its own file.
	Update the tests to cover both backends.
	Skip the PerlIO backend tests if PerlIO is not availible.
	For whatever reason, make noisy ugly META.yml after upgrades.
	Let the user specify implementation, f ex: ":stdout(perlio)".
	Test this new interface.
	Update the POD.

0.0.16	Tue Sep 19 21:52:03 CEST 2006
	Note dependency on perl 5.8.0 and Time::HiRes.
	Pod updates to Builder.pm.
	Added tests for layer permutation :raw:warn:stderr:stdout:exit:die.
	Added tester tests for TODO and SKIP.

0.0.15	Mon Sep 18 23:53:05 CEST 2006
	Move the extension interface into its own Test::Trap::Builder.
	Change the extension interface somewhat:
	  - methods on the builder object, not the calling package;
	  - simpler methods for making accessors;
	  - methods also for registering test method prototypes;
	  - generate test methods from accessor + test pairs;
	  - ... even if the test or accessor is inherited;
	  - &layer_implementation needs both $module and $Builder now;
	  - update the tests accordingly.
	Also, added some new tests for the builder.

0.0.14	Tue Sep  5 16:40:13 CEST 2006
	Rewrite the "layer:$name" methods:
	  - return the layer implementation rather than be it, and
	  - can handle multi_layer definitions as well,
	  - changing &layer, &layer_implementation, and &multi_layer.
	Update the POD accordingly.
	Add an example using the extension interface.
	Polish the POD, and add some more vertical spacing.

0.0.13	Tue Aug 29 06:54:05 CEST 2006
	Add the standard test methods.
	Document them -- overall, not one by one.
	Test them -- using Test::Tester.
	Add a dependency on Test::Tester.
	Add a trustme for the pod coverage check.
	Add a dependency on Data::Dump (for quoting, more or less).
	Add factories for accessors and test methods.
	Let array accessors produce elements and slices as well.
	Add extra test methods: did_die, did_exit, did_return, quiet.
	Document these.
	Test them -- using Test::Tester.

0.0.12	Sun Aug 27 03:05:45 CEST 2006
	Don't trap exits in children!  Revert to outer exit-handler instead.
	Test undefined *CORE::GLOBAL::exit.
	Test forked exits.
	Document the fork/exit caveat.
	Rename some layers: :return:raw are now :raw:flow.
	Base non-empty layer specifications too on :default.
	Tests updated accordingly.

0.0.11	Sun Aug 27 01:51:30 CEST 2006
	Test a bad class definition.
	Clean up the code.

0.0.10	Sun Aug 27 01:18:09 CEST 2006
	Add tests for subclassing.
	Implement subclassing.

0.0.9	Sat Aug 26 23:51:26 CEST 2006
	Implement layers as methods, anonymous or with mangled names.
	Update the special layers test accordingly.
	Move POD to beyond __END__.

0.0.8	Sat Aug 26 22:19:53 CEST 2006
	s/mode/leaveby/g;

0.0.7   Thu Aug 24 04:35:04 CEST 2006
	Implement user-defined trapper layers!  Wrappers are now layers!
	Test trapper layers!

0.0.6   Thu Aug 24 02:28:08 CEST 2006
	Protect the method calls of the local $trap test.
	Pull the wrapper list out of the exported sub and into its factory.
	Add a &write_trapper factory to replace &_trap_std{err,out}.
	Trap warnings as well.
	Add tests for trapping warnings.

0.0.5	Wed Aug 23 18:32:28 CEST 2006
	Back to exporting just a scalar instead of the glob.
	Export an anonymous closure combo instead of our $trap / &trap.
	Eliminate our $trap / &trap.  (Use a factory instead.)
	Update the tests accordingly.

0.0.4   Wed Aug 23 15:44:00 CEST 2006
	New test: Apply local() to the scalar.
	Implementation: Export a glob instead of just the scalar.

0.0.3   Wed Aug 23 03:39:03 CEST 2006
	Decompose the different wrappers.  Eliminate the %trap hash.
	Update tests to account for:
	 - missing 'die' was '', is now undef;
	 - void 'return' was [undef], is now [];
	 - missing 'return' was context dependent, is now undef.

0.0.2   Wed Aug 23 00:01:14 CEST 2006
	Export a global scalar, by default $trap, instead of &trapped.
	Make &trap merely the default name of the function.
	Update tests accordingly.
	Test for ->import failing in various ways.
	Query exists &CORE::GLOBAL::exit instead of defined *...{CODE}.
	Add pod.

0.0.1   Sun Aug  6 15:26:47 CEST 2006
        Began extracting useful stuff from messy old code.
